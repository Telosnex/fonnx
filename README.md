# FONNX
## Any model on any edge
Run ML models natively on any platform. ONNX models can be run on iOS, Android, Web, Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## What is FONNX?
FONNX is a Flutter library for running ONNX models.
Flutter, and FONNX, run natively on iOS, Android, Web, Linux, Windows, and macOS. 
FONNX leverages [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) to provide native acceleration capabilities, from CoreML on iOS, to Android Neural Networks API on Android, to WASM SIMD on Web.
Most models can be easily converted to ONNX format, including models from Pytorch, Tensorflow, and more.

## Getting ONNX Models
### HuggingFace ðŸ¤—
[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) has a large collection of models, including many that are ONNX format. 90% of the models are Pytorch, which can be converted to ONNX.

Here is a search for [ONNX models](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=onnx). 

### Export ONNX from Pytorch, Tensorflow, & more
A command-line tool called `optimum-cli` from HuggingFace converts Pytorch and Tensorflow models. This covers the vast majority of models. `optimum-cli` can also quantize models, significantly reduce model size, usually with negligible impact on accuracy.

See [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/onnx/usage_guides/export_a_model) or the 
quick start [snippet on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum#run-the-exported-model-using-onnx-runtime).  
Another tool that automates conversion to ONNX is [HFOnnx](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/pipeline/train/hfonnx/). It was used to export the text embeddings models in this repo. Its advantages included a significantly smaller model size, and incorporating post-processing (pooling) into the model itself.

- [Netron](https://netron.app/) allows you to view ONNX models, inspect their runtime graph, and export them to other formats

### Text Embeddings
These models generate embeddings for text.
An embedding is a vector of floating point numbers that represents the meaning of the text.  
Embeddings are the foundation of a vector database, as well as retrieval augmented generation - deciding which text snippets to provide in the limited context window of an LLM like GPT.  
  
Running locally using FONNX provides significant privacy benefits, as well as latency benefits.
For example, rather than having to store the embedding and text of each chunk of a document on a server, they can be stored on-device.
Both MiniLM L6 V2 and MSMARCO MiniLM L6 V3 are both the product of the Sentence Transformers project. Their website has excellent documentation explaining, for instance, [semantic search](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html)

#### MiniLM L6 V2
Trained on a billion sentence pairs from diverse sources, from Reddit to WikiAnswers to StackExchange.
MiniLM L6 V2 is well-suited for numerous tasks, from text classification to semantic search.
It is optimized for [symmetric search](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html#symmetric-vs-asymmetric-semantic-search), where text is roughly of the same length and meaning.
Input text is divided into approximately 200 words, and an embedding is generated for each.  
[HuggingFaceðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)  

#### MSMARCO MiniLM L6 V3
Trained on pairs of Bing search queries to web pages that contained answers for the query. 
It is optimized for [asymmetric semantic search](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html#symmetric-vs-asymmetric-semantic-search), matching a search query to an answer.
Additionally, it has 2x the input size of MiniLM L6 V2: it can accept up to 400 words as input for one embedding.
